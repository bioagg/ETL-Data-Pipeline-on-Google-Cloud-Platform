# Weather API - ETL Data Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform
This repository serves as a demonstration of an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, designed to manage and analyze weather data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Developed for educational purposes in collaboration with DataProjects.io under the guidance of my colleague and friend Michalis Chionidis.

### Project Overview:
The project highlights the implementation of a robust ETL pipeline, showcasing proficiency in cloud technologies and data engineering practices. By leveraging GCP, the pipeline effectively handles real-world data workflows, demonstrating comprehensive skills in managing and analyzing weather data.

## Skills Demonstrated
-  API Interaction: Automated data extraction from OpenWeather API.
-  Data Manipulation: Utilized Python and Pandas to clean and transform data.
-  Cloud Services: Deployed automated ETL workflows to extract, process, and store data on production using GCP services like Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage.
-  Data Visualization: Created an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio.
